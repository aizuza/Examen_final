                The Water Cure is a feminist dystopian revenge fantasy by Sophie Mackintosh. First published in 2018, and longlisted for the 2018 Booker Prize, the novel follows what happens when three sisters fight back against their fatherâ€™s oppressive regime. Critics
                praise the book for its comments on toxic masculinity and the capacity for violence against women. Mackintosh is best known for her short stories which have featured in prominent publications such as Granta and TANK magazine. She has won
                numerous awards for her writing, including the 2016 White Review Short Story Prize. The Water Cure is her debut novel.</p>

            <p class="text">In The Water Cure, a family has sequestered itself on an island to protect themselves against this spreading poison. Three daughters, Grace, Lia and Sky, live alone with their mother and their father, whom they call King, and who claims to
                be the exception to the rule. They are just close enough to the mainland to see the in the distance "the round glow of the horizon, the air peach-ripe with toxicity." They fence their borders, kill animals who might be carrying the toxins,
                and submit to elaborate purifying rituals. "There is no hiding the damage the outside world can do, if a woman hasn't been taking the right precautions to guard her body."</p>
